# Enabling CPU temperature control on RbPi (optional)

As an option, one can install software that enables RbPi board temperature. This is possible **only for clusters with the PoE board containing a small display panel** (visible in the upper part of the board). If you are interested in trying this option, please refer to [this link](https://github.com/darkfence/PoE_HAT-B-temp-control) where the sources and installation guide are available.

If you have Raspberry Pi 5 model(s) and would like to play with temperature control, please ask the instructor for advice.
