# Monitoring service-level metrics
## Introduction
The main objective of this part of the laboratory is to provide basic knowledge of service monitoring that can be used during service orchestration where decision-making is based on service level indicators. This should be clearly distinguished from resource monitoring and resource-level management/orchestration. The scenario involves monitoring emulated 5G network.

The RAN part of the network will be emulated using UERANSIM, 5G core will be built upon containerized Open5GS platform, and the deployment of both components will be based on Gradiant Helm charts.

For service level orchestration is our only focus in this lab, the 5G network configuration and deployment topic is addressed very briefly. We will cover only the absolute minimum necessary to get the 5G environment up and running. Then we will monitor selected service-level metric using Prometheus. This will underpin our understanding of service monitoring in preparation to Project 2.
